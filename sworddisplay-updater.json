    "1.15.2-1.1.0": "* Added comparator input depending on the weapon's damaged state:\n  * If the Sword Display is empty, it will emit 0 strength.\n  * If the Sword Display contains an undamaged sword, it will always emit 15 strength.\n  * If the Sword Display contains a damaged sword it will follow the following formula:\n    ```java\n        int x = stack.getMaxDamage() / (stack.getMaxDamage() - stack.getDamage());\n        x = x > 15 ? 14 : x == 15 ? 13 : x;\n        return 15 / x;\n    ```\n    What this means:\n      * If the damage for the weapon is far too great, or if it is nearly broken the power output would be 1.\n      * If the damage the weapon suffered is minimal or none at all, the power output would be 15 or 14.\n      * Anything else will be calculated depending on how damaged the item is. \n* Added minimum required forge version to **1.15.2-31.2.22**\n* It should work on servers now.",
